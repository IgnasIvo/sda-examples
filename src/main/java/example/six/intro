Our previous examples have a flaw which was ignored until now.

Hold onto your hats.

Beer is a drink, not a drink.

While both drink and drink are thing we consume, there are differences on how we consume them.
In our current stage, a watermelon and some nice coca cola would be consumed the same way, and that is just disturbing.

We need to give the classification more options to branch out - we need to make our classes more abstract.
Abstraction.
Abstraction is a java mechanism which allows us to specify as little information as possible,
so that it can be easily replaced with other logic, allowing us to interact with all kinds of objects in a manner that's fit.

We dont need to eat our coca cola or beer. We dont want to drink our watermelon.

Let's try to abstract our foods and drinks as much as we can.

Food and drink are both, first things first, things that we consume. They are Consumable.
To consume drink, we chew it and then swallow it. To drink a drink, we just need to swallow.
