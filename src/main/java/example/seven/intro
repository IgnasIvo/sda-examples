We now have abstracted our consumable objects to a certain point.
Lets kick it up a notch and fuse our BeerCan with our abstractions.

To make it a little less repeating, lets replace BeerCan with WaterBottle.

What is a water bottle? It's a container that holds a drink.

a drink is a consumable. so is a food. It's quite possible that we may need to hold our food in containers in the future as well.

So a container can hold a consumable.
A container can be of a certain size.

To achieve this, we will use two more mechanisms - Enumerations and Generics.
